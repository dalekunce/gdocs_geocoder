#Batch Google Geocoding Script and Data Exporter
==============
##Purpose
I needed a geocoder for gdocs that is fast and reliable.
Script uses Google Maps API for geocoding.
Script also includes some great work that the @mapbox team did to create a geoJSON download of the file.

##Install
- Copy the source of gdocs_geocoder.js
- Open your spreadsheet and goto tools > script editor
- Replace the content in the text box with the copied source from gdocs_geocoder.js
- Set the name of this script to geocoder
- Go to file > save and close the popup window
- Refresh your spreadsheet and you will see a new menu called Geocoder added after Help on the menu bar

##Credit
- [MapBox] (http://mapbox.com/) team for the geojson export
- Alan Christopher Thomas for the initial Google Maps geocoder
